      <h3>True Crime: Streets of LA</h3>
      <p id="trueCrimeGameStory">
        One of my earliest memories of gaming is playing "True Crime: Streets of LA", a police detective game that was rated 16+.
        I was too young to play it, but I was fascinated by the story and the gameplay. I loved chasing down criminals,
        fighting them, and arresting them. I felt like I was making a difference in the city and bringing justice to the people.
      </p>

        When I was in primary school, taking 4th class, a teacher gave us a task to make true and false statements about
        certain actions and what I did is saying something like this:<br><br>

        <code>True Statement: I am 10 years old<br>
        False Statement: I am 4 years old<br><br>

        True Statement: X found guilty<br>
        False Statement: X found not guilty<br><br></code>

        When a teacher looked at this stuff, she said: You are going to be a jury at court.
        That time, I wasn't really understanding why that was the case, but now, in my adult age,
        I can get the idea why that teacher assumed in that way. As reading my given statements, it was pretty clear that
        they were related the stuff that juries do in the court where there is a case between two possible people.
        And my statement is practically usable by the people who are testifying to the judge and that makes an impact to
        juries to collect all details and then make a decision about it.
        <br><br>
        Lol, but obviously I wasn't become a person who works for law enforcement area. Maybe, I just was up to understanding
        the teacher's assignment better that lead me to handle it "professionally", so that I could get her attention in that way.

      <h3>Far Cry</h3>
      <img id="farCryImg" src="/media/far-cry-1.jpg" />
      <p class="farCryGameStory">
        The next game that I enjoyed playing a lot was Far Cry 1 and its modifications. This game offered me a great experience of exploring
        different locations and applying strategic thinking to overcome the challenges by using various weapons effectively.
        I also liked how the game had missions that required me to succeed in different objectives.
      </p>
      <p class="farCryGameStory">One of the aspects that I found both amusing and terrifying was the presence of mutants and
        the reactions of the human enemies that included a lot of weird cursing words against my game characters.
        I recall once where I encountered a mutant downstairs, and I threw a grenade at it, the grenade caused a glitch
        and the mutant started to move erratically, as if it was dancing. I could not stop laughing at that hilarious situation.
        <br><br>
        I played this game for a long time, till to my second year of university studies. What made me really hooked to the game
        was the ability to use its CryEngine editor, which allowed me to design the game as I wished. I could edit, add,
        and change things, such as characters, models, names, and so on. This was a fun hobby for me, but I did not go too deep into it.
        I was satisfied with the basic features that I had at my disposal.

      <h3 id="csSourceMobileHeading">Counter Strike: Source</h3>

      <h3 id="csSourceDesktopHeading">Counter Strike: Source</h3>
      <p class="csSourceStory">
        Counter-Strike: Source was a great game, but I began to feel that I was investing too much time without much value.
        Although playing on community servers was enjoyable, I decided to shift to mobile games.
      </p>
      <h3>Mobile Games</h3>
      <img id="mobileGamesImg" src="/media/mobile-games-on-android.jpg" />
      <p id="mobileGamesStory">
        During the era of mobile games, I sought to achieve small accomplishments to feel fulfilled during moments of boredom.
        Consequently, I primarily engaged in RPG games, viewing them as a form of relaxation. However, I eventually quit
        as I found them to require too much thinking and focus, contrary to my initial goal of simply having fun and experiencing gameplay.
      </p>
      <h3 id="csGoHeading">Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h3>
      <img id="csGoImg" src="/media/cs-go.png" />
      <p id="csGoStory">
        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive became my choice after taking a break. Playing this game, I sensed a more mature gaming experience.
        Although I concentrated on improving my skills and understanding gameplay better, dealing with annoying and toxic players in random matches
        proved challenging, often leaving me frustrated and struggling to keep my composure.
      <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        A great way I found to enjoy Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was creating a table to track info about
        competitive maps and match lengths. I would strike through completed ones, allowing me to focus on new matches.
        After finishing all, I'd reset and create another table. It's such a fun thing to do, isn't it?
      <br><br>
        I continued this road until CS2 was introduced, at which point
        I had to quit due to my current laptop not supporting CS2.
