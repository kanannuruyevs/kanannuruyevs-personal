    <h2 class="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p class="summary">I started coding in C++ and Java during my Bachelor's studies, but wasn't interested at all,
        so most of the time, I got busy with doing research and deliver presentations at seminars based on lecture topics.
        After graduation, I became an IT intern, but unfortunately,
        my internship was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that led me to work only as a freelancer,
        where I was up to create two PowerPoint slides for clientâ€™s specifications. Then, I initially
        faced several life challenges; sending proposals to clients after my first job ever didn't help,
        instead, I met with financial difficulties and disruptions to my future plans, such as
        education abroad that caused me to decline my application process.
        <br><br>
        I stayed determined and used the break time to explore potential career paths and refine my personal skills.
        Last year, I discovered programming with important decision of my life to begin learning Python through
        an Android App and kept my keen interest in exploring other programming & markup languages, such as JavaScript,
        HTML & CSS, in order to get into software & web development as a potential job duty now.
        I was also prone to bother with the issues of the software, mostly related to Linux apps and extensions, which led
        me to increase my usage of GitHub by opening issues and making pull requests and engaging in
        reporting bugs, suggesting new features, correcting mistakes in the documentation, etc. Furthermore, I
        think this involvement allowed me to enhance my enthusiasm and overall experience in IT field.
